# Linear least square fit and plotting with uncertainty

## I. Introduction

This code is used as plot tool in my second year physics lab period. It can import data from a comma delimitated csv file and generate linear best fit line with residuals and uncertainties.

## II. Theory

I used method of least squares[1] in a linear function of x and y,
$$
y=mx+c
$$
where m is the gradient and c is the y-intercept.
$$
c=\frac{\sum_i{x^2_i}\sum_iy_i-\sum_i{x_i}\sum_ix_iy_i}{\Delta}
$$

$$
m=\frac{N\sum_ix_iy_i\sum_ix_i\sum_iy_i}{\Delta}
$$

with the uncertainty in the intercept and the gradient,
$$
\alpha_c = \alpha_{CU}\sqrt{\frac{\sum_ix_i^2}{\Delta}}
$$

$$
\alpha_m = \alpha_{CU}\sqrt{\frac{N}{\Delta}}
$$

where 
$$
\Delta = N\sum_ix_i^2-(\sum_ix_i)^2
$$
and $\alpha_{CU}$ is **common uncertainty** defined as
$$
\alpha_{CU} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N-2}\sum_i(y_i-mx_i-c)^2}
$$
